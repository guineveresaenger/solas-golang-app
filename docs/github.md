## Configure Collaborators & Teams

From the 'Settings' section, go to the "Collaborators & teams" tab, then
add "commontools" as a team with admin privileges (required for
[Slack](./docs/slack.md) notifications) and "kraken-reviewers" as a team
with write privileges (required for [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS)).
